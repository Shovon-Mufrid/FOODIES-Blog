Yakitori is the ultimate food. It can be fancy (think 3 Michelin starred restaurants) or be made at home. The chicken yakitori is amazing, but even better are the vegetable skewers. Most fancy yakitori places actually place higher value on the vegetable skewers because seasonal vegetables are exceptional and high value in Japan. You can get special vegetables like the first negi of spring(extra large Japanese green onions) or roasted gingko nuts.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>What is yakitori?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Yakitori is Japan&rsquo;s answer to grilled chicken. Yakitori is bite-size pieces of chicken threaded onto skewers and grilled over binchotan, a special Japanese charcoal that gets extra hot. The skewers come seasoned with salt (shio) or sauce (tare).</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Is yakitori chicken only?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Yakitori is technically chicken but colloquially, people refer to all grilled Japanese skewers as yakitori.

It adds umami, a glorious brown sheen, and is delicious. If you can, try to use Japanese soy sauce for this dish.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Sake</strong> &ndash; Sake is Japanese rice wine. It adds umami and a natural sweetness. Just like wine in French cooking adds an extra layer of aroma and flavor, sake is common in Japanese cooking &ndash; it&rsquo;s in almost every sauce. They sell cooking sake at Asian grocery stores, or if you&rsquo;re feeling flush, you can use the nice sake you have for drinking. Buy a bottle and you won&rsquo;t regret it, it&rsquo;ll take your Japanese cooking to another level.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Mirin</strong> &ndash; Mirin is Japanese sweet rice wine and the other ingredient that is key in Japanese cooking. Compared to sake, it has a lower alcohol content and higher sugar content that occurs naturally from fermentation. It&rsquo;s used as a seasoning and glazing agent.

Mein, of course, means noodles.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>American Chinese lo mein</strong> is a stir fry noodle dish: thick noodles mixed with a soy sauce based sauce and toppings like beef, pork, chicken, or vegetables.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Both are delicious!</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Chow mein vs lo mein</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The main difference between lo mein and chow mein are the noodles used. Lo mein noodles are thicker and chewier and chow mein noodles are thinner and crisper. Chow mein is cooked longer in the pan so the noodles become crispy and lo mein is simply tossed so the noodles stay soft.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both kinds of noodles are made with flour, water, eggs, and kansui (which is what makes the noodles yellow and chewy). They differ mostly in hydration and shape. Lo mein noodles have a higher hydration and are thicker which makes them chewier and more plush. Chow mein noodles are thinner, drier, and crisp up more because they have a lower hydration. After cooking, lo mein noodles are soft and supple and chow mein noodles are springy and chewy.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>How to make lo mein</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>This is probably the easiest take out dish you can make. All you need to do is make a quick sauce, cook the noodles, add some veggies, and toss:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li><strong>Make the sauce.</strong> In a small bowl, mix together light and dark soy sauce, toasted sesame oil, sugar, and ground ginger.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Cook the noodles.</strong> Cook the noodles according to the package, drain, and set aside.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Fry the aromatics.</strong> Heat up a bit of oil and lightly fry some garlic until it smells amazing.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Add the mix-ins.</strong> I kept this simple with veggies, but you can add protein too, more on that later.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Toss.</strong> Add the noodles and sauce into the pan and toss everything until it&rsquo;s evenly coated.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Enjoy.</strong> That&rsquo;s it! Slurp away.</li>\r\n</ol>", "blog_image": "blog_image/lo-mein-0982-Editw.webp", "publish_date": "2023-04-19T06:50:00.507Z", "update_date": "2023-04-19T06:50:00.507Z"}}, {"model": "Blog_App.blog", "pk": 8, "fields": {"author": 2, "blog_title": "Singapore Noodles", "slug": "Singapore-Noodles-b470b81e-06f8-49c4-b42e-b629a38a40fa", "blog_content": "<h2>What are Singapore noodles?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Singapore noodles, sometimes called Singapore-style noodles or Singapore fried noodles, are a stir-fried rice vermicelli noodle dish flavored with curry powder.

The noodles usually come with vegetables, scrambled eggs, and a protein, most commonly chicken, pork, shrimp, or a combination of all three.

Instead, it sets by using either gelatin, or in this case, whipping cream. It&rsquo;s perfect because you don&rsquo;t have to turn on your oven and it&rsquo;s really easy to make. This oreo cheesecake is super simple with a base of cream cheese and heavy whipping cream. You set it in the freezer and it settles into a creamy kind of ice cream texture. I love it frozen, but you can defrost it in the fridge and it tastes just like regular cheesecake.￼￼</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>How to make no bake Oreo cheesecake</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s really simple: crush up some Oreos and mix with melted butter for the base of the cheesecake. The cheesecake itself is whipped room temperature cream cheese, heavy cream, sugar, and crushed Oreos￼. That&rsquo;s it! The most time you spend on this is waiting for the cheesecake to set. Quick and easy and perfect for quarantine &ldquo;baking.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>No bake Oreo cheesecake ingredients</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The best part about this recipe &ndash; aside that you don&rsquo;t even have to turn the oven on &ndash; is that the ingredient list is so short.
